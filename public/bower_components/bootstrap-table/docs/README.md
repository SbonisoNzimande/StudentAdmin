# Documentation

Bootstrap table's documentation, included in this repo in the root directory, is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and publicly hosted on https://bootstrap-table.wenzhixin.net.cn. The docs may also be run locally.

## Running documentation locally

1. If necessary, [install Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation) (requires v2.5.x).
  - **Windows users:** Read [this unofficial](https://jekyll-windows.juthilo.com/) guide to get Jekyll up and running without problems.

2. Install the Ruby-based syntax highlighter, [Rouge](https://github.com/jneen/rouge), with `gem install rouge`.
3. From the root / directory, run `jekyll serve` in the command line.
4. Open https://localhost:4000 in your browser, and voil√†.
